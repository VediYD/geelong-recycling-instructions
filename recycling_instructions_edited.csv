Organic Matter,fruit,red,Place in the red lid rubbish bin. At present food waste cannot be included in the garden organics bin because the composting facility used by City of Greater Geelong does not have an EPA licence to process food organics. Most councils allowing food organics into their green bins  are close to a commercial compost facility that is able to process this material under a specific EPA composting licence. This is especially the case with Melbourne Metropolitan councils where the population density allows private composting operators to run a viable service for food organics. For the small number of non-metro councils maintaining this service they are a long distance from a processing which adds significant cost to maintain this service. At this stage there are no facilities in the Geelong area with the capacity to take all of Geelong’s garden and food organics. The City recognises that allowing food organics into the green bin may have benefits and will be reviewing whether this is viable for the City in the future.
